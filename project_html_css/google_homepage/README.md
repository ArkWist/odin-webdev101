# Google Homepage Clone

This is an approximate visual copy of the google.co.jp homepage. I made it to practice HTML and CSS as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Project: HTML/CSS](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)** for more information.

### What I learned

I was already familiar with HTML and CSS from prior personal projects. But as I hadn't made a page from scratch since late 2014, this project proved a great catalyst for review. I'm now just a little more comfortable with layout positioning and accomodating a wide range of window sizes.
