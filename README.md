# Rails Blog

A sandbox for experimenting with Ruby on Rails following a tutorial I found through **[The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/)** which was enlightening a read but not too good at explaining the nuts and bolts of what I was actually doing.

The next project is a simple blog interface ([blogger](https://github.com/ArkWist/blogger)) with what I think is a superior tutorial.
