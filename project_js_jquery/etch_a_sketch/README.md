# Etch-A-Sketch

Etch-A-Sketch lets you draw by dragging your mouse across the screen. The number of cells can be changed, but the size of the drawable window stays the same. I made this to practice JavaScript and jQuery as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Project: Javascript/jQuery](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/javascript-and-jquer)** for more information.

### What I learned

These are technologies I'm going to have to experiment with much more in the near future. I'd never used JavaScript nor jQuery, so though the project is simple and straightforward to build I'm glad to have learned how to couple methods with HTML.
