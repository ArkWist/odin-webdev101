# Blogger

Blogger is a simple blog interface and my first proper Ruby on Rails project (still through tutorials). I made it to practice making Ruby on Rails applications as part of [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. 

See **[Project: Rails](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/ruby-on-rails)** for more information.

### What I learned

Will update this when I can be more descriptive, though of course I'll be implementing CRUD functionality.
