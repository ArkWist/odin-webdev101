# RailsGuide's Rails Blog

A Ruby on Rails practice project following the RailsGuide's **[Getting Started With Rails](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)** tutorial I found through [The Odin Project](http://www.theodinproject.com/).

I thought the **[blogger](https://github.com/ArkWist/blogger)** project a superior introduction to Rails.
